TODO:

1. Finalize the speed of shots, make sure no exposures are missed
2. Finalize the main script and emergency script
3. Practice, Practice and Practice, review taken shots



- Practice manual shots for partial phases AND totality
- Decide whether to buy second tracker
- Get laptop ready for EO use on eclipse day

- Print Nick's checklist
- Go over Nick's checklist 
- Plan packing all my gear
- Make new filter
- find GPS time drift, set clock to actual time
- Center the exposures with MAX eclipse : DONE
- check if Having another card impacts the write speed: DONE: Use Rec Separately
